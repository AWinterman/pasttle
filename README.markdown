Overview
========

Pasttle is based upon http://sprunge.us, born out of the necessity to:
  - Have a lightweight pastebin software
  - Not depend on Google AE
  - Paste via CLI

Also, I wanted to play more with bottlepy.org


Installation
============

Pasttle is part of PyPI, you can just:

    pip install pasttle

and it should pull all the necessary components. Wether you want to install
it in a virtual environment (which I recommend) or system-wide is totally up
to you.

If you instead want to try from source code (i.e. by cloning the git repo) 
then I suggest you execute:

    python setup.py install

... and be done with it. Again, if you do this in a virtual environment or
not is up to you.
